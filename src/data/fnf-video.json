   "description": "This video is a summarization of the build process for one of my final projects. This final project was constructed for my basic embedded systems class. In the video, I try to explain the important concepts that I learned throughout the year, and the challenges I faced while creating the project. This includes discussion of frequencies in waves, state machines, and how electrical components work together with a microcontroller.",
